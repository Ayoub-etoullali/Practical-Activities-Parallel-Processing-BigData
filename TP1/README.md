## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)
- [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Kafka Setup

### Option 1: Manual Setup

1. **Download Kafka:** Download Apache Kafka from the [official website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads) and extract it.

2. **Start ZooKeeper:** Start ZooKeeper by running the following command in the Kafka directory:

   ```bash
   bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

3. **Start Kafka Server:** Start the Kafka server with the following command:

   ```bash
   bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
   ```

5. **Test Kafka:** Use `kafka-console-producer.sh` and `kafka-console-consumer.sh` to test Kafka's functionality.

### Option 2: Docker Setup

1. **Create `docker-compose.yml`:** Create a `docker-compose.yml` file based on the [Docker Compose example](https://developer.confluent.io/quickstart/kafka-docker/).

2. **Start Docker Containers:** Run the following command to start Kafka and ZooKeeper containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Test Kafka:** Use `kafka-console-producer` and `kafka-console-consumer` as described above to test Kafka.

## Developing Kafka Services

In this section, you can describe how to create Kafka producers, consumers, and stream processors using Spring Cloud Streams. Provide links to relevant documentation or code examples.

## Running the Services

Explain how to run the Kafka services you've developed, including any required configurations and dependencies.
